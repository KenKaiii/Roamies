# Privacy

Effective date: 10 November 2026

Roamies is an open-source desktop app made by an individual developer. This page says, in plain words, what
data Roamies handles and where it goes.

## The short version

- The developer runs no servers and collects nothing from you.
- There is no analytics or telemetry.
- Data leaves your computer only to services you choose to use, listed below.

## What leaves your computer, and where it goes

**The AI provider you sign in to** (Anthropic via Claude Code, OpenAI/ChatGPT, or a provider you add with an API
key) receives:

- your messages and the conversation so far
- a "live state" block: the date and time, your time zone, the name or title of the app and window in front,
  and the facts and commitments Roamies has saved in memory
- screenshots or window text, when Roamies looks at your screen to answer

**Fish Audio** or **Google** (Gemini), whichever you pick as the voice, receives the text of each reply to speak it, only if spoken replies are on. It uses your own key for that service (for Gemini, the Gemini key you added for the AI is used unless you save a separate one for the voice).

**GitHub** is used to check for and download updates.

**Hugging Face** is used once, on Windows and Linux, to download the speech model.

**Wikipedia** is used to fetch photos for photo cards, and websites' `favicon.ico` is fetched for source cards.

**Websites** that you or the agent open or fetch (for example with its `fetch_url` tool) receive the usual
request a browser would send.

Each provider's own privacy policy applies to what is sent to it.

## Speech, microphone and screen

- **macOS:** speech is turned into text on your Mac by Apple's on-device recognizer. On Macs where on-device
  recognition isn't available, Apple's recognizer may use Apple's servers, under Apple's terms.
- **Windows and Linux:** speech is turned into text on your computer (Parakeet).
- The microphone is used only while you hold the talk keys (or, on Linux with Wayland, from your talk shortcut
  until you press it again or pause).
- The screen is captured only when Roamies answers something about your screen, or when you mark an area. On Linux
  with Wayland it's taken through your desktop's screenshot portal; the copy the portal saves is deleted right away.

## What's stored on your computer

Everything lives in `~/.gg` (on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\.gg`) and stays on your computer:

| File or folder           | What's in it                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sidekick.json`          | your settings                                                                       |
| `sidekick/memory.json`   | facts Roamies learned and your commitments                                          |
| `sidekick/sessions/`     | conversations (the newest 60 are kept)                                              |
| `sidekick/logs/`         | activity logs: tool names, timings, errors and short snippets of tool results (such as a line of window or page text); text you type into apps or files is reduced to its length; kept 7 days |
| `sidekick/usage.jsonl`   | token counts and timings only, never content                                       |
| `auth.json`              | your AI sign-ins, shared with GG Coder                                              |

**Save Diagnostics** (the panel's About page, or the tray icon's menu) writes one `roamies-diagnostics-….log` file to
your Downloads folder, only when you ask. It holds the logs above, your system and screen details, your microphones and
permission states, and your settings. Keys, tokens, email addresses, names, your home folder and user name are removed
first. Nothing is uploaded: it stays on your computer unless you choose to send it (for example by attaching it to a
GitHub issue).

Your Fish Audio key and your Gemini voice key are kept in the macOS Keychain, encrypted with DPAPI on Windows, or in your desktop's keyring
(through the Secret Service) on Linux.

You can see what Roamies remembers on the panel's **Memory** page, and remove it with **Forget** or
**Forget Everything**.

## Deleting everything

Follow the [Uninstall](README.md#uninstall) steps in the README.

## Children

Roamies isn't made for children under 13 (or the minimum age in their country), and it doesn't ask about age.
Parents should supervise any use by children.

## Changes

Changes to this notice are made in this file on GitHub, so its history shows what changed and when.
